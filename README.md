# Quarto Template for An MSc Dissertation

This is a simple template that I used for drafting my AI MSc dissertation report, using VSCode with a Quarto Extension and some Jupyter Notebook results, graphs etc.

The majority of the content has been derived from a couple of existing sources that created PhD thesis reports and I have used these to build my working template. So thanks to:
- A very clear guide to setting this up and the main source for this: [Cameron Patrick](https://cameronpatrick.com/post/2023/07/quarto-thesis-formatting/)
- This Edinburgh PhD thesis format: [Nick Hood](https://github.com/NixImagery/SWE-quarto-thesis)
- Another Edinburgh PhD Template [James H](https://github.com/james-d-h/quarto-phd-thesis)

## Customisation

This template produces a report in the style set by the Univesity of Stirling, but can obviously be easily customised to meet the requirements of other institutions.

I have only just started using Quarto so any comments, suggestions, improvements are gratefully received.
